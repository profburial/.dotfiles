# Dotfiles

Hi. These are my dotfiles. If you're reading this, you probably think I'm super cool and want to be just like me. 


You can use my config if you want. It's maybe a pretty okay idea, but probably not worth your time.  


You'll probably want to use these on a *nix machine, preferably osx. If your toaster follows POSIX they might work there.
Give it a shot. If they don't you should probably submit an issue.
